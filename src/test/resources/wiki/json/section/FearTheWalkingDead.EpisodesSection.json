Strand bribes a guardsman to save Nick, who is feverish from heroin withdrawal. (The soldiers and medical crew are observing their prisoners for symptoms and taking their temperature regularly). Liza helps Dr. Exner with patients at the hospital. Ofelia hurls debris at the Safe Zone gate, enraged because the soldiers took Griselda. Adams calms her and takes her home.

Adams begs Daniel not to kill him, saying he can guide them to the hospital and out of it.  Adams privately warns Travis that Daniel will kill Adams when he is no longer useful and Travis decides to release him. The group goes to National Guard headquarters. Daniel distracts the guards by leading a horde of walkers from the arena to the headquarters perimeter. Travis, Madison, Daniel, and Ofelia get inside the base, leaving Alicia and Chris with their vehicles. Inside the base, Strand and Nick launch their escape plan.  Strand callously leaves other detainees locked in their cells. Meanwhile, the walkers breach the perimeter defenses and swarm the base. Travis' group comes across the holding cells and frees the detainees before reuniting with Nick, Liza, and Strand. They try to escape through the medical ward, where they find Dr. Exner has euthanized all the patients. Dr. Exner tells them about an escape route before presumably committing suicide. Before they can escape, the group encounters Adams, who shoots Ofelia in the arm. Enraged, Travis brutally beats Adams and leaves him for dead. Strand leads the group to his oceanside mansion, where he tells Nick he will escape on his yacht, the ''Abigail'', which is anchored just off the coast. On the beach, Liza tells Madison she was bitten during the escape. Liza pleads with Madison and Travis to euthanize her before she turns. Travis promises to protect Chris before shooting Liza.  Madison tries to comfort the grieving Travis.\n| LineColor       = 78000D\n}}\n}}"}}}
